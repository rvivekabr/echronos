# Motivation

The RTOS currently does not support the Atmel AVR target platform that is popular in Arduino devices.
For those devices, the Arduino IDE defaults to a very simple application structure with only a `setup()` function run once and a `loop()` function run as a central event loop.
With support from the RTOS, this structure could be intuitively expanded to multiple pseudo-parallel loops in the form of tasks.


# Goals

- support the rigel RTOS variant (and all smaller variants) on AVR microcontrollers
    - support in particular building systems, context switching, interrupt events, and timers on the AVR platform
- provide sample systems and build output that plugs easily into the Arduino IDE


# Release Impact: Minor


# Test Plan

- review code
- existing regression tests must pass
- system tests for all supported variants on AVR must have been added and must pass
